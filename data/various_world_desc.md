<p>
    Various World in time of release of v3.5.2 was pretty big project. It wasn't vanilla-like at all with some stuff in any aspect of game.
    This concept of variety of content with low quality and remainings of code from earlier versions of mod that were made with mcreator where
    trashing project, as a result - mod needed a global review.
    <hr>
    In development of remake versions - Lyof(author of End's Phantasm)'s registry was used, that simplified and cleaned code that were remained from 1.20.1 version. Textures were redrew, models remade - instead of bosses and rpg stuff, content for QoL in game were added, including: gemsmithing, portable beacon(artifact table), disassembly table and so on that don't impact game that much what did in former versions.
